To build whiteboard, you'll need the usual toolchain (gcc, g++ and make) and the following libraries. The names of the libraries are taken from Ubuntu's database. If you're using a different Linux distro, please change them according to yours:

  * libcwiid0-dev
  * libsdl-sge-dev
  * libgtkmm-2.4-dev
  * libglademm-2.4-dev
  * libxtst-dev
  * libsdl-dev

If you have checked out whiteboard from our SVN repository, you probably need those too: 
  * autoconf
  * automake

Having gotten those installed, navigate to the program's root directory and issue these commands:

If it was a SVN snapshot, do these first:
{{{
autoconf --install
}}}

For all users:
{{{
./configure && make
}}}

To install whiteboard, run this command as root:
{{{
make install
