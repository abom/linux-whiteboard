To check out the CPP branch of Linux Whiteboard -which the dependencies below mostly apply to- issue the following command:
{{{
svn checkout http://linux-whiteboard.googlecode.com/svn/branches/cpp/ linux-whiteboard-read-only
}}}

To build whiteboard, you'll need the usual toolchain (gcc, g++ and make) and the following libraries. The names of the libraries are taken from Ubuntu's database. If you're using a different Linux distro, please change them according to yours:

  * libcwiid1-dev
  * libconfuse-dev
  * libgtkmm-2.4-dev
  * libglademm-2.4-dev
  * libxtst-dev
  * libcairomm-1.0-dev
  * libsigc++-2.0-dev

If you have checked out whiteboard from our SVN repository, you probably need those too: 
  * autoconf
  * automake

Having gotten those installed, navigate to the program's root directory and issue the following commands:
{{{
./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install
}}}

----

For *Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon* users, you need to add *CXXFLAGS="-DCOMPATIBILITY_GUTSY"* to autogen.sh like this:
{{{
./autogen.sh CXXFLAGS="-DCOMPATIBILITY_GUTSY"
}}}

----

To install to a different directory, so that you don't need root permission when installing, add *--prefix=<path-to-desired-install-dir>* like this:
{{{
./autogen --prefix=~/whiteboard
}}}

After 'make install', whiteboard will be installed to the directory 'whiteboard' in your home directory.

----

To build a Debian/Ubuntu package (same rules applied if you use *Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon*):
  * Install *fakeroot* if you haven't got it already.
  * Issue these commands:
{{{
./autogen.sh
dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b -rfakeroot
}}}
