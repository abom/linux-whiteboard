## Linux electronic whiteboard ##

This is an effort to make a GNU/Linux port of the program seen [here](http://procrastineering.blogspot.com/2007/12/low-cost-multi-point-interactive.html).

We plan to enhance the usability of the program, and make it stable enough for everyone to use, on any GNU/Linux distribution.

Update 2010-01-23:
The project has been discontinued in the interests of other Wiimote developments. If anyone is willing to take up the role, please contact Pere Negre or me (vanhtu1987). Pere has his own version of Whiteboard written in Python over here: http://github.com/pnegre/python-whiteboard that is more actively developed. Downloads here: http://github.com/pnegre/python-whiteboard/downloads Wiki here: http://wiki.github.com/pnegre/python-whiteboard/

For 3D tracking with the Wiimote, I've built a library in Python that is currently used by my private projects. Upon request I will open a new Google Code project for this. The library is complete and should be easy to use.
